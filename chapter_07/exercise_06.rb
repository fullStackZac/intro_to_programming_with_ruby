Given the following code...


x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

ANSWER: In my_has, x is a symbol and different from the string variable created above the hashes.  In my_hash2 x is using the string variable
initialized above and place "some value in as the value"
