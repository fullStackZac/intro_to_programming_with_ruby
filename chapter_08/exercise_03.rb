#What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
#ANSWER: Exception handling is the process of writing code designed to catch unpredicatble errors.
#        It solves the unpredicatability issue.  YOu do not always know what a user will do with 
#        the tools you give them (and really you do not always know how soundly your own code is tied together)
#        This just gives a good layer of security to catch a bunch of those blindside errors coming at you
